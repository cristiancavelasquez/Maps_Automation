# Maps Automation
The main purpose of this project is to automate the process of determining the geographical area in which given coordinates are located. In the case of the company where the project was developed, these geographical areas are known as UTC and can be interpreted in a certain way as postal zones.

## Context
The company where this project was developed is a data analysis firm specializing in the pharmaceutical sector. Their information sources are pharmacy chains, and their clients are pharmaceutical laboratories. When a new supplier joins the company, a person within the company receives the addresses of all the supplier's retail locations and must place them within a UTC[^1]. Sometimes, the suppliers include coordinates for their retail locations as part of the address.






[^1]: A geographically delimited area for georeferencing purposes, based on the concept of a zip code. However, some modifications are made to it, with large cities being subdivided into smaller zones and small cities being treated as a single zone.
